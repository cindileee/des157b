            Project Brief
        </h1>

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>

        <p>
            The Davis Centennial Seal Treasure Hunt is a mobile website that encourages participants to explore the city of Davis and learn about the historical significance of various landmarks and objects. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Participants will collect virtual icons based on the University Panel section of the seal by taking pictures at each location paired with a short reflection about their perspective and experience. These will all be posted to a public gallery. Each icon is accompanied by detailed information about its historical significance to educate participants about Davis’ history and culture.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>

        <p>
            The goal is to encourage participants to explore Davis and learn more about the city’s history and culture through an engaging game. The images shared by participants will also document the different perspectives of the people of Davis. 
        </p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>

        <p>
            Very streamlined, sleek design. Emphasis on usability. More focus on the images of the seal and location hotspots. Cartoon-like graphic icons to act as collectible locations. 
        </p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>

        <p>
            We plan for participants to begin in the landing page with a map that is populated with animated icons aka markers of each landmark. When the participant clicks on an icon, they are brought to a new page with an image of the landmark, map with the location, some historical facts about the landmark, and images from other participants taken at the landmark. The users are encouraged to click the add photos button to upload their own image. Once they have collected all the markers, they will receive a congratulations animation to celebrate their success. 
        </p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>

        <p>
            We hope that this game can be a fun, engaging way for participants to explore Davis, especially the UC Davis campus and gain a deeper understanding of the historical significance of different landmarks. To keep the user engaged, we will use aesthetic graphics and animations. 
        </p>

        <h2>Target Users</h2>
        
        <p>
            California 11th-12th graders who are planning to go to college and college freshmen are interested in history and learning more about the city of Davis.
        </p>

        <h2>Responsibility Break Down</h2>

        <p>
            Cindy’s going to focus on figuring out incorporating informational content with leaflet’s mapping system while Erika will focus on figuring out storing data with local storage and using geolocation API to figure out routing information. Both girls plan to work on the design and coding together with Cindy focusing more on CSS while Erika focuses on JS.
