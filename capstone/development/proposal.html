            Capstone Project Proposal
        </h1>

        <p>
            For my project, I want to create a scavenger hunt game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. For children, it is best that they play with adult supervision. At the moment, I plan to work on this by myself, but I am open to working with my peers if we have the same idea. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I want users to be able to upload photos or selfies of them at various spots that are in the seal and be able to collect them in a private photobook or if they are comfortable, a shared album online. With each photo, they unlock the corresponding part of the seal that they visited. After visiting all parts of the seal, they unlock a full seal. I also want to make a map with clues for the scavenger hunt, as well as, sprinkle facts throughout the game to further educate users. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a bit concerned about how the website would know if the photos were taken at the right place. It might just have to be an honors system or I could try to incorporate geo-location but that seems really difficult.
