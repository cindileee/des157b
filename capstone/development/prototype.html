        <p>
            My user had trouble going to a previous page because I forgot to include a back button, so I will be adding that to my website. They also had trouble finding the add photos button, so I will be finding a way to highlight that feature more. They also did not understand the badges page since I did not include a title or description, so I will also be adding that.
