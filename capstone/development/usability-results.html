        <h2>Observations</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                The directions feature was not working because the user's location services for Safari was not turned on. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Users did not understand the directions, especially because they were in meters instead of miles. They also said they did not bother to read them because they just referenced the map.
            </li>

            <li>
                Icon for Seal Page made them think it was a scrapbook instead.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Update Landing Page (clear instructions for location services, introduce connection to seal)
            </li>

            <li>
                Delete instructions and improve location feature 
            </li>

            <li>
                Find a different icon for the badge page and have an an animation for the  badges when earned
