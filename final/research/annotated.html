                <p>
                    This article documents the various eggheads around UC Davis and their historical significance, description, and location. Since one of the markers of my treasure hunt mobile website is an egghead, this website will be helpful when I include historical facts and descriptions for the egghead page.

                <p>
                    One of the markers on our treasure hunting map is the Arboretum. This article focuses on the Arboretum during WW2 that I thought was really interested and rarely talked about. Including some information from this article would be really informative and interesting for our target audience.

                <p>
                    Another one of the markers on our treasure hunting map is the Mondavi Center. This article focuses the center's history, which would be interesting to add to our website as historical facts. This article mainly focuses on how their foundeers, Robert Mondavi, Margrit Mondavi, and Barbara Jackson, founded the Mondavi Center to promote performing arts at UC Davis.
