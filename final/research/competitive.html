                    In general, it is an engaging, interactive game that helps users learn more about a topic while having fun. The clues for each questions were very helpful because even when I Googled the answers, it was hard figuring it out without the additional clues. I almost gave up because I initially missed the clue, thus clues are crucial to keeping users engaged and for a smooth user experience.

                <p>
                    One of my ideas was to create a scavenger hunt games and this inspired me to possibly incorporate location APIs.

                <p>
                    The US Mint has some kids games on their website and the "Making Change" game allows users to customize their own digital coin.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    One of my ideas was to create a website where community members could create their own digital seal and it would have similar features and capabilitites as this game. I like that each category is nicely labeled but when a user clicks on the category to see the options, it covers the coin which is not a nice design. I would have the coin visible at all times for my design.
