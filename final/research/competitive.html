                    In general, it is an engaging, interactive game that helps users learn more about a topic while having fun. The clues for each questions were very helpful because even when I Googled the answers, it was hard figuring it out without the additional clues. I almost gave up because I initially missed the clue, thus clues are crucial to keeping users engaged and for a smooth user experience.

                <p>
                    One of my ideas was to create a scavenger hunt games and this inspired me to possibly incorporate location APIs.

                    The US Mint has some kids games on their website and the "Making Change" game allows users to customize their own digital coin.

                <p>
                    One of my ideas was to create a website where community members could create their own digital seal and it would have similar features and capabilitites as this game. I like that each category is nicely labeled but when a user clicks on the category to see the options, it covers the coin which is not a nice design. I would have the coin visible at all times for my design.
